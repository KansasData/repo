# Community Data Lab Projects

Community Data Labs are specially-structured classes devoted to independent, small group inquiry focused on real-world projects provided by our Community Partners. These partners are businesses, government agencies, non-profits, and other organizations who have agreed to contribute a problem and related dataset. With the consent of our partners, some of these projects and datasets have been made available for public access.

## Projects

Each project contains a proposal - a document describing background information, the current problem, and desired inquiries – in addition to relevant datasets. Projects may also contain sample code, visualizations, reports, and analyses.
