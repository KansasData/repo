<p>The project utilizes a variety of datasets to assess the child care climate in Kansas state. Key data sources include Kansas child care licensing information from the KIDS COUNT Data Center, accessibility data from Child Care Aware of Kansas. This dataset provides a comprehensive landscape of the child care in Kansas from 2017 to 2024. It includes data on various types of child care facilities, including child care centers and licensed family/group homes, as well as their capacities and enrollment figures.</p>
<p>The data includes original data source (i.e., PDF file) from the Child Care Aware of Kansas report as well as refined dataset used in the analysis.</p>
