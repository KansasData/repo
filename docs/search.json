Having the context and logic of statistics allows data scientists to collect, analyze, and interpret data effectively. This competency includes knowledge of statistical tests, probability, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing.Strong statistical foundations help with making informed decisions based on the data, identifying trends, and predicting future outcomes.\nIn practice, a data scientist uses statistical methods to make sense of large datasets and to determine the reliability of the conclusions drawn from the data. For example, data scientists might use statistics to evaluate whether a difference in air quality between two regions is more affiliated with differences in nearby pollutants or nearby plant life. This is crucial in fields ranging from business to public health, where strategic decisions, particularly the allocation of limited resources, are often based on data analysis.\nOur repository prioritizes curriculum materials which employ and develop foundational statistic skills.

Faculty from our educational partners collaborate to create open-source coursework that is adaptable to various institutions and academic majors. The repository features two primary components: the Community Data Lab and the Curriculum, both designed to support and enhance data science education.\n\n\nProjects\nThe Community Data Lab is our signature program which brings real-world projects into the classroom. This section of the repository is where we house deidentified data, analysis code, materials, and project reports from previous semesters. This open-source framework is designed to provide a rich array of projects suited for data science education. These projects may be used in future Community Data Labs by the KDSC or can be adapted for other data science courses.\n\nProjects »\n\n\n\nCurriculum\nOur curriculum repository contains content from a wide range of data science courses- from introductory classes to advanced machine learning. This includes lecture materials, analysis code, exercises, and datasets, all systematically organized . This curriculum is crafted to build essential data science skills and competencies, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience. Our modules can be implemented in data science education settings to enrich and expand students’ understanding.\n\nCurriculum Repository »\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
