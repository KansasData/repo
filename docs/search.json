Having the context and logic of statistics allows data scientists to collect, analyze, and interpret data effectively. This competency includes knowledge of statistical tests, probability, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing.Strong statistical foundations help with making informed decisions based on the data, identifying trends, and predicting future outcomes.\nIn practice, a data scientist uses statistical methods to make sense of large datasets and to determine the reliability of the conclusions drawn from the data. For example, data scientists might use statistics to evaluate whether a difference in air quality between two regions is more affiliated with differences in nearby pollutants or nearby plant life. This is crucial in fields ranging from business to public health, where strategic decisions, particularly the allocation of limited resources, are often based on data analysis.\nOur repository prioritizes curriculum materials which employ and develop foundational statistic skills. Modules which involve statistical foundations can be combined with other educational materials to embellish coursework and may mesh particularly well with courses which are already covering statistics.\n\nExplore Materials »\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

A priority issue in the upcoming 2024 legislative session will be child care access in Kansas, as policymakers and advocates are seeking a resolution to the ongoing crisis throughout the state. The goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the current child care landscape in Kansas through state and local-level data, establish a comparable understanding of the child care landscapes in states regional to Kansas, and attempt to create a predictive outcome for Kansas based on the students’ findings."

KAC accomplishes this goal through bipartisan advocacy, partnership, and information-sharing on key issues. A priority issue in the upcoming 2024 legislative session will be child care access in Kansas, as policymakers and advocates are seeking a resolution to the ongoing crisis throughout the state. The goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the current child care landscape in Kansas through state and local-level data, establish a comparable understanding of the child care landscapes in states regional to Kansas, and attempt to create a predictive outcome for Kansas based on the students’ findings."

    "section": "Learning the R Language",
    "text": "Learning the R Language\nR is controlled by commands that you type into RStudio’s Console. It takes some time to learn how to properly phrase commands, but doing so opens up many exciting possibilities for you! You typically type in one command at a time and hit  to get an immediate response from R. It’s like a chat room with your computer.\n\nR as a Calculator\nAt its most basic level, you can use the R console as a calculator. In the following grey box, you can see the command I entered and R’s response (following #&gt;).\n\n(9.5 + 3.75 - 1.25) * (3 / 2)^2\n#&gt; [1] 27\n\nNote that R uses periods (.) to mark decimals and doesn’t like commas or spaces inside numbers. So type numbers out like 1234567.89 and not like 1,234,567.89 or 1 234 567,89.\n\n\nCreating Objects\nJust like creating variables in algebra, we can store information in temporary objects in R. For instance, we can tell R that x refers to the number 57.23 We do this using the &lt;- operator, which we read as “x gets 57.23.” Any time we want to see what information is stored in an object, we can send a command to R including only its name; this is called printing it.\n\nx &lt;- 57.23\nx\n#&gt; [1] 57.23\n\nThe main purpose of creating objects is to use them in future commands. This can be very handy.\n\n(x - 32) * (5 / 9)\n#&gt; [1] 14.01667\n\nWe can also give objects more descriptive names, which makes them easier to remember and understand. There are several rules about what names are allowed to be. For now, let’s stick with simple names that only include letters (without numbers, spaces, or symbols) as doing so will never break those rules. Below, we can see how descriptive names clarify what the previous (ambiguous) operation was doing: converting a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n\ntempF &lt;- 57.23\ntempC &lt;- (tempF - 32) * (5 / 9)\ntempC\n#&gt; [1] 14.01667\n\n\n\nUsing Functions\nR has the ability to transform objects in many useful ways. This is usually accomplished using functions, which I like to think of as recipes (e.g., in baking). A recipe calls for ingredients and includes a series of steps for transforming those ingredients into a tasty treat. Similarly, functions in R call for inputs and include a series of steps for transforming those inputs into an output. The telltale sign that a function is being used in R is text followed by parentheses. Continuing the baking analogy, I think of these parentheses as the edges of a mixing bowl that you put the ingredients/inputs into. For example, we can use the sqrt() function to calculate the (principal) square root of an input number (i.e., x).\n\nsqrt(x = 25)\n#&gt; [1] 5\n\nThere are many useful functions built into R! Another one that will help us learn the basics is the round() function, which will round the input number to a specified number of digits (i.e., decimal places). In this case, we need two inputs: the number to round (i.e., x) and the number of digits to round to (i.e., digits). We can accomplish this by separating each ingredient with a comma.\n\nround(x = 2/3, digits = 4)\n#&gt; [1] 0.6667\n\nThe digits input allows us to configure the function’s behavior. This means that R can have a single round() function and doesn’t need to have separate functions for rounding to, e.g., 1 or 2 or 5 digits.\n\nround(x = 2/3, digits = 2)\n#&gt; [1] 0.67\n\n\n\nVector Objects\nOne function that we use very frequently is the c() function. Note that the name is lowercase c, which I think of as being short for “collect.” It groups multiple similar objects (e.g., numbers) into a single collection object, which we refer to as a vector. Note that this function can take any number of inputs, each of which does not have an individual name.\nCollecting objects into a vector will not only keep those objects together, but there are functions that let us do two useful things with vectors. To showcase this, let’s create a simple vector called grades to store the grades of five students on a recent exam.\n\ngrades &lt;- c(78, 84, 91, 92, 94)\ngrades\n#&gt; [1] 78 84 91 92 94\n\nFirst, we can use a vector to transform all sub-objects at once. For example, imagine that there was a scoring error and all grades are 2 points lower than they should be. Instead of needing to add 2 to each of the five grades individually, I can simply add 2 to the vector once and it will apply to all the grades at once. That would be a huge time savings in a course with many students!\n\ncorrected &lt;- grades + 2\ncorrected\n#&gt; [1] 80 86 93 94 96\n\nSecond, we can use a vector to summarize across the sub-objects. For example, I might want to calculate the number of students in the class, the minimum and maximum grades, and the average grade. By giving the corrected vector to special functions in R, we can do this easily.\n\nlength(x = corrected)\n#&gt; [1] 5\n\nrange(x = corrected)\n#&gt; [1] 80 96\n\nmean(x = corrected)\n#&gt; [1] 89.8\n\n\n\nCharacter Data\nSometimes we need to provide R with text instead of numbers. This type of data is called character data and each instance is called a string. Just like numbers, we can collect strings into vectors and there are special functions that can transform and summarize character data. In R, we mark each string by surrounding it with quotation marks (\"). Here are a few examples:\n\ncustomers &lt;- c(\"John Smith\", \"Jane Doe\", \"Joe Bloggs\")\ncustomers\n#&gt; [1] \"John Smith\" \"Jane Doe\"   \"Joe Bloggs\"\n\ntoupper(x = customers)\n#&gt; [1] \"JOHN SMITH\" \"JANE DOE\"   \"JOE BLOGGS\"\n\nnchar(x = customers)\n#&gt; [1] 10  8 10"

It is an object type called a data frame, which is essentially multiple vectors combined together such that each row represents one observation (in this case, one car model) and each column represents one variable (in this case, an attribute like horsepower hp or fuel efficiency mpg). Most of the time, you will be using data frames for data analysis and visualization tasks.\n\nBasic Summaries\nOften the first thing you should do after accessing a dataset (i.e., before visualizing or analyzing it) is to summarize it. This will provide a set of summary statistics for each variable/column, including its minimum (Min.), first quartile (1st Qu.), median (Median), mean (Mean), third quartile (3rd Qu.), and maximum (Max.). These five numbers provide a good summary of extreme values (min and max), common values (first and third quartiles), and central tendencies (mean and median).\n\nsummary(object = mtcars)\n#&gt;       mpg             cyl             disp             hp       \n#&gt;  Min.   :10.40   Min.   :4.000   Min.   : 71.1   Min.   : 52.0  \n#&gt;  1st Qu.:15.43   1st Qu.:4.000   1st Qu.:120.8   1st Qu.: 96.5  \n#&gt;  Median :19.20   Median :6.000   Median :196.3   Median :123.0  \n#&gt;  Mean   :20.09   Mean   :6.188   Mean   :230.7   Mean   :146.7  \n#&gt;  3rd Qu.:22.80   3rd Qu.:8.000   3rd Qu.:326.0   3rd Qu.:180.0  \n#&gt;  Max.   :33.90   Max.   :8.000   Max.   :472.0   Max.   :335.0  \n#&gt;       drat             wt             qsec             vs        \n#&gt;  Min.   :2.760   Min.   :1.513   Min.   :14.50   Min.   :0.0000  \n#&gt;  1st Qu.:3.080   1st Qu.:2.581   1st Qu.:16.89   1st Qu.:0.0000  \n#&gt;  Median :3.695   Median :3.325   Median :17.71   Median :0.0000  \n#&gt;  Mean   :3.597   Mean   :3.217   Mean   :17.85   Mean   :0.4375  \n#&gt;  3rd Qu.:3.920   3rd Qu.:3.610   3rd Qu.:18.90   3rd Qu.:1.0000  \n#&gt;  Max.   :4.930   Max.   :5.424   Max.   :22.90   Max.   :1.0000  \n#&gt;        am              gear            carb      \n#&gt;  Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :3.000   Min.   :1.000  \n#&gt;  1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:3.000   1st Qu.:2.000  \n#&gt;  Median :0.0000   Median :4.000   Median :2.000  \n#&gt;  Mean   :0.4062   Mean   :3.688   Mean   :2.812  \n#&gt;  3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:4.000   3rd Qu.:4.000  \n#&gt;  Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :8.000\n\nHere we can see that all the cars have between 52 and 335 horsepower (hp), half of the cars have between 96.5 and 180, and the average is 146.7 This is also a good opportunity to check for outliers, errors, and missing values. For example, if I saw that the minimum hp was negative, I would double-check the data as that would result in a very strange car.\n\n\nBasic Visualizations\nIt is often useful to create quick visualizations of your main variables of interest. For instance, we can create histograms to examine which values of horsepower (hp) and fuel efficiency (mpg) are more and less common. This can be done using the hist() function and the $ operator. This operator allows us to extract a specific column from a data frame. For instance, we can use mtcars$hp to extract (and then visualize) the horsepower numbers.\n\nhist(x = mtcars$hp, xlab = \"Horsepower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also optionally use the xlab input to control the label of the x-axis. Let’s repeat with the mpg variable.\n\nhist(x = mtcars$mpg, xlab = \"Miles per Gallon\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s explore if there is a relationship between cars’ horsepower and fuel efficiency. To do so, we can use the plot() function and use the x and y axes to represent each variable.\n\nplot(x = mtcars$hp, y = mtcars$mpg, xlab = \"Horsepower\", ylab = \"Miles per Gallon\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like cars with higher horsepower generally have lower fuel efficiency, although this relationship seems to “slow down” or “level off” after around 200 horsepower."
