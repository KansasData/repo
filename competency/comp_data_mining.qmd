Data mining is the process of discovering patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data. The competency involves not just handling data, but also selecting the appropriate methods to extract useful information that may not be immediately obvious. Techniques such as clustering, classification, association rule mining, and anomaly detection are commonly used in this area.

For a data scientist, data mining means sifting through massive datasets to find meaningful insights that can influence decision-making processes. It's like being a digital prospector, looking for nuggets of valuable information among the vast expanses of data. This skill is especially useful in environments where data is not only big but also complex, such as in marketing or financial analysis.
