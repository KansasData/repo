Statistical foundation is the backbone of data science. It involves understanding the principles of statistics that allow data scientists to collect, analyze, and interpret data effectively. This competency includes knowledge of statistical tests, probability, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing. A strong statistical foundation helps in making informed decisions based on the data, identifying trends, and predicting future outcomes.

In practice, a data scientist uses statistical methods to make sense of large datasets and to determine the reliability of the conclusions drawn from the data. For example, they might use statistics to evaluate whether a difference between two groups is due to chance or represents a true difference in behavior. This is crucial in fields ranging from business to public health, where strategic decisions are often based on data analysis.
