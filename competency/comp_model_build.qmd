Model building is the process of creating data-driven models for predictive analysis or to understand data relationships. This competency requires both an understanding of the algorithms used in modeling and the ability to apply them appropriately. Common tasks include selecting the right model, training the model with data, testing it, and refining it to improve accuracy.

In practical terms, model building allows data scientists to forecast future trends, classify data, and make decisions based on data predictions. It is a core component of many data science applications, such as risk management, algorithmic trading, and customer behavior prediction. Effective model building depends on not only technical skills but also on a deep understanding of the problem domain to ensure that the models are both accurate and relevant.
