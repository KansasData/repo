Model building involves creating data-driven models to understand data relationships or to perform predictive analysis. This competency requires an understanding of the algorithms used in modeling and the ability to apply them appropriately. Common tasks include selecting the right model, training the model with data, testing it, and refining it to improve accuracy.

In practical terms, model building allows data scientists to forecast future trends, classify data, and make decisions based on data predictions. It is a core component of many data science applications, such as risk management, algorithmic trading, and customer behavior prediction. Effective model building depends on technical skills and on a deep understanding of the problem domain to ensure that the models are both accurate and relevant.

Model building relies on the confluence of all competencies. Materials from our repository which are designed to develop model building skills can be combined with other coursework to enrich the experience.
