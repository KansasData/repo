Programming skills are the building blocks of data science. These skills involve the ability to write and understand code, primarily in languages such as Python, R, or SQL. Programming allows data scientists to interact with data, perform tasks, create automations, and implement algorithms that help in analyzing and interpreting data.

Basic programming skills are vital to modern data science because they are the method through which all data science is performed. Advanced programming skills enable data scientists to be versatile and innovative in solving problems. They can write scripts to automate repetitive tasks, develop models to make predictions, or create interactive data visualizations. This competency is indispensable to all fields which rely on data science to turn raw data into actionable insights.

Our repository contains materials which utilize and improve programming skills. Although most modules will interact with programming, some are specifically designed around building this competency.
