Data engineering focuses on the practical application of data collection and data processing frameworks that are scalable and optimized for performance. This competency involves the architecture of data systems and the management of data flow, which includes data gathering, data storage, and data access. Technologies such as databases, big data frameworks, and cloud services are commonly utilized tools in data engineering.

For data scientists, understanding data engineering is crucial because it enables them to design systems that handle and process large volumes of data efficiently. Efficient data systems help ensure that data analysis tasks can be performed quickly and reliably, allowing organizations to leverage their data effectively and gain competitive advantages.
