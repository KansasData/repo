This website serves as an online repository for data science curriculum materials developed by the ARISE team. Faculty from the [KDSC](https://data.ku.edu/kdsc) collaborate to create open-source coursework that is adaptable to various institutions and academic majors. The repository features two primary components: the Community Data Lab and the Curriculum, both designed to support and enhance data science education.

### Community Data Lab

The Community Data Lab serves as a repository where, with the consent of our community partners, we store deidentified data, analysis code, materials, and project reports. This open-source framework is designed for future use in the Community Data Lab and other data science courses, fostering an environment of shared resources and collective learning.
