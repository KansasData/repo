This is an online repository for data science curriculum material developed by ARISE team. The faculty from the [KDSC](https://data.ku.edu/kdsc) works collaboratively to develop open-source coursework that can be tailored to each institution and different majors. There are two major components of the repository: Community Data Lab, and Curriculum.
